        <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        The App Owner allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements within the Said App. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send advertisements and links that appear on the Said App directly to the User’s browser. They automatically receive the User’s IP address when this happens. They may also use other technology (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content the User sees.        </p>

        The App Owner does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without the User’s consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which the User will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks the App Owner to show an advertisement to a certain audience and the User responds to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that the User fits the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding the User’s use of the Said App, such as the number of times the User viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to the User.        </p>
